# Theory: Clock State-Space Models

The ensemble subpackage models a precision oscillator as a linear
stochastic differential equation (SDE) whose state vector promotes
the polynomial coefficients of the deterministic clock model — phase,
frequency, and (optionally) frequency aging — to states driven by
independent Wiener processes. Discretising the SDE on a uniform
sample interval `τ` yields the propagator `Φ` and the innovation
covariance `Q` that drive the discrete-time
[Kalman filter](kalman.md) used by SigmaTauEnsemble.

This page collects the time-domain models in one place: the
deterministic polynomial skeleton, the two- and three-state SDEs that
generalise it, the closed-form discretisation `(Φ, Q)`, and two
non-stationary phenomena — frequency-jump detection and deterministic
clock-error jumps — that sit alongside the stationary noise model.

## Polynomial clock model

The polynomial clock model decomposes phase deviation into a low-order
Taylor expansion plus a stochastic residual:

```math
x(t) \;=\; x_0 + y_0 \, t + \tfrac{1}{2}\, D\, t^{2} + \varepsilon(t),
```

with `x₀` the initial offset, `y₀` the initial fractional-frequency
offset, `D` the linear frequency drift, and `ε(t)` the stochastic
noise [Banerjee & Matsakis 2023](@cite banerjee-2023-timekeeping). The
same decomposition appears in IEEE-1139 as the optimal time-prediction
model `x̂(t_p) = x(t₀) + y(t₀) τ_p + ½ D τ²_p`
[IEEE 1139-2022](@cite ieee1139-2022-definitions), and in the HP
Application Note 1289 frequency-stability primer
[Allan, Ashby & Hodge 1997](@cite allan-1997-hp-app1289).

Banerjee and Matsakis warn that the polynomial decomposition is best
read as a local Taylor expansion: real oscillator drifts can be
logarithmic, so the polynomial form is an approximation around the
present epoch [Banerjee & Matsakis 2023](@cite banerjee-2023-timekeeping).
The `½ D t²` phase contribution from frequency drift produces ADEV
and MDEV slopes `σ_y(τ) = D τ / √2` and a TIE of roughly
`1.2 σ_x(τ)` [Allan, Ashby & Hodge 1997](@cite allan-1997-hp-app1289).

The polynomial coefficients become the states of the canonical
three-state SDE below; flicker noises (any non-integer fractional
integration order) cannot be represented as a finite-state SDE driven
by Wiener processes, so the SDE family truncates to the integer-FM
ladder and excludes flicker FM by construction
[Zucca & Tavella 2005](@cite zucca-2005-clock-model-allan).

## Two-state clock SDE

The two-state SDE models phase $X_1$ and frequency $X_2$ as a pair
of integrated Wiener processes:

```math
\begin{aligned}
dX_1 &= (X_2 + \mu_1)\,dt + \sigma_1\,dW_1, \\
dX_2 &= \mu_2\,dt + \sigma_2\,dW_2.
\end{aligned}
```

`σ₁` drives white-FM phase noise and `σ₂` drives random-walk-FM
frequency noise [Zucca & Tavella 2005](@cite zucca-2005-clock-model-allan).
This is the special case of the general three-state SDE with
`μ₃ = σ₃ = 0`, and is the canonical model when the dominant noises
are white FM and random-walk FM
[Zucca & Tavella 2005](@cite zucca-2005-clock-model-allan).

The closed-form Allan variance for the stationary two-state clock is

```math
\sigma_y^{2}(\tau) \;=\; \frac{\sigma_1^{2}}{\tau} \;+\; \frac{\sigma_2^{2}\,\tau}{3} \;+\; \frac{\tau^{2}}{2}\,c_3^{2},
```

with the `τ⁻¹` branch from white FM and the `τ¹` branch from
random-walk FM
[Zucca & Tavella 2005](@cite zucca-2005-clock-model-allan). The
diffusion coefficients are recovered from observed slopes: `σ₁` from
the `τ⁻¹/²` ADEV branch at small `τ` and `σ₂` from the `τ⁺¹/²`
branch at large `τ` [Zucca & Tavella 2005](@cite zucca-2005-clock-model-allan).

In the time-and-frequency community the metrological fractional
frequency `y(t)` is identified with `dX₁/dt` rather than with the
state `X₂` — a distinction that is often misused in the literature
[Zucca & Tavella 2005](@cite zucca-2005-clock-model-allan). The
phase-noise of a real clock is the sum of direct phase shocks and the
integral of frequency shocks, so the two-state model already requires
both to be modelled separately rather than collapsed into a scalar
process [Stein 2003](@cite stein-2003-timescales). For cesium-class
clocks the two-state model is empirically supported by Allan-deviation
slopes of `τ⁻¹/²` for `τ < 10⁶ s` and `τ⁺¹/²` for `τ > 10⁷ s`
[Stein 2003](@cite stein-2003-timescales). Tryon and Jones formulated
the original cesium-clock state-space estimator with white-noise
increments scaled by `√δ` to keep variances proportional to interval
length [Tryon & Jones 1983](@cite tryon-1983-cesium-parameter-estimation).
USNO maser-ensemble Kalman implementations continue to use the same
two-state form
[Breakiron 2001](@cite breakiron-2001-kalman-timescales).

In SigmaTau the two-state SDE corresponds to [`TwoStateClock`](@ref).

## Three-state clock SDE

The three-state SDE adds a frequency-aging (drift) state $X_3$
driven by its own Wiener process, with `X₂` now coupled to `X₃`
through an integrating term:

```math
\begin{aligned}
dX_1 &= (X_2 + \mu_1)\,dt + \sigma_1\,dW_1, \\
dX_2 &= (X_3 + \mu_2)\,dt + \sigma_2\,dW_2, \\
dX_3 &= \mu_3\,dt + \sigma_3\,dW_3.
\end{aligned}
```

This is the canonical Wiener-driven model for cesium, hydrogen-maser,
and rubidium clocks and underlies the discrete Kalman filter used in
clock-ensemble timekeeping
[Zucca & Tavella 2005](@cite zucca-2005-clock-model-allan),
[Stein 2003](@cite stein-2003-timescales),
[Tryon & Jones 1983](@cite tryon-1983-cesium-parameter-estimation).
With `σ₃ > 0` the integrated frequency increments cease to be
stationary, so the resulting Allan variance acquires explicit
dependence on the absolute epoch `t_k`:

```math
\sigma_y^{2}(t_k, \tau) \;=\;
\frac{\sigma_1^{2}}{\tau}
+ \frac{\sigma_2^{2}\,\tau}{3}
+ \frac{\sigma_3^{2}\,\tau^{3}}{20}
+ \sigma_3^{2}\!\left(\frac{\tau^{3}}{3} + \frac{\tau^{2}\, t_k}{2}\right)
+ \frac{\tau^{2}}{2}\!\bigl[c_3 + \mu_3(\tau + t_k)\bigr]^{2}.
```

The Hadamard variance, by contrast, depends on `τ` alone and remains
finite under random-run drift:

```math
H\sigma_y^{2}(\tau) \;=\; \frac{\sigma_1^{2}}{\tau} + \frac{\sigma_2^{2}\,\tau}{6} + \frac{11}{120}\,\sigma_3^{2}\,\tau^{3} + \frac{\mu_3^{2}\,\tau^{4}}{6},
```

which is one operational reason to prefer the
[Hadamard family](allan_family.md) for records in which `σ₃` is
non-negligible
[Zucca & Tavella 2005](@cite zucca-2005-clock-model-allan).

Tryon and Jones distinguish three frequency-drift hypotheses for the
state $X_3$ — drift-free, deterministic constant drift, and
random-walk drift — and report the first valid statistical test
between them on a 333-day NBS dataset of seven cesium clocks: the
constant-drift model improves `−2 ln L` by 41 over the no-drift model
(highly significant under `χ²(6)`), while adding random-walk drift on
top yields essentially zero further improvement
[Tryon & Jones 1983](@cite tryon-1983-cesium-parameter-estimation).
Frequency drift is statistically significant only for end-of-life or
freshly commissioned cesium clocks; middle-life clocks showed none
over a one-year window
[Tryon & Jones 1983](@cite tryon-1983-cesium-parameter-estimation).

The three-state SDE can be augmented with deterministic-time
Heaviside-step terms in each state to capture phase, frequency, or
drift jumps observed in GNSS space clocks (see
[Clock error jumps](#clock-error-jumps) below)
[Zucca & Tavella 2015](@cite zucca-2015-clock-error-jumps).

In SigmaTau the three-state SDE corresponds to
[`ThreeStateClock`](@ref).

## State-transition matrix Φ

The state-transition matrix `Φ` is the closed-form discrete-time
propagator that advances the clock state through one sample interval
`τ`. Without process noise the SDE integrates exactly to a Taylor
expansion in `τ`; the three-state propagator is upper-triangular with
polynomial-in-`τ` entries:

```math
\Phi \;=\; \begin{bmatrix}
1 & \tau & \tau^{2}/2 \\
0 & 1     & \tau \\
0 & 0     & 1
\end{bmatrix},
```

applied to the state $[x, y, \omega]^\top$
[Stein 2003](@cite stein-2003-timescales). Frequency aging contributes
the `τ²/2` off-diagonal entry to the phase row because aging
integrates twice into phase
[Stein 2003](@cite stein-2003-timescales). The discrete iterative
solution of the linear SDE is

```math
X(t_{k+1}) \;=\; \Phi_\tau\, X(t_k) + B_\tau M + J_k, \qquad J_k \sim \mathcal{N}(0, Q),
```

with the Gaussian innovation `J_k` carrying all the stochastic
content [Zucca & Tavella 2005](@cite zucca-2005-clock-model-allan).
The discrete-time recursion is exact for the linear Wiener-driven SDE:
there is no discretisation error in the Wiener integration
[Zucca & Tavella 2015](@cite zucca-2015-clock-error-jumps).

For an `m`-clock ensemble of `n`-th-order homogeneous clocks the
global propagator factors as `F = A ⊗ I_m`, where `A` is the per-clock
polynomial transition matrix
[Yan et al. 2023](@cite yan-2023-structured-kf-timescale). Stacking
per-clock states block-diagonally is the standard NBS Kalman
convention
[Tryon & Jones 1983](@cite tryon-1983-cesium-parameter-estimation),
and is also how Breakiron's USNO maser ensemble assembles its
two-state per-clock blocks
[Breakiron 2001](@cite breakiron-2001-kalman-timescales).

In SigmaTau, `Φ` is built by the
[`state_transition`](@ref) hook on each `AbstractClockModel`.

## Process-noise covariance Q

The discrete-time process-noise covariance `Q` is the covariance of
the Gaussian innovation `J_k` driving the clock state forward by one
sample interval `τ`. It is obtained by integrating
`Φ_t · diag(σ_i²) · Φ_tᵀ` over `[0, τ]`. For the canonical three-state
SDE the entries are exact polynomials in `τ` that depend only on the
diffusion coefficients `σ₁, σ₂, σ₃` — independent of the absolute
epoch `t_k`
[Zucca & Tavella 2005](@cite zucca-2005-clock-model-allan):

```math
Q \;=\;
\begin{pmatrix}
\sigma_1^{2}\tau + \tfrac{1}{3}\sigma_2^{2}\tau^{3} + \tfrac{1}{20}\sigma_3^{2}\tau^{5}
& \tfrac{1}{2}\sigma_2^{2}\tau^{2} + \tfrac{1}{8}\sigma_3^{2}\tau^{4}
& \tfrac{1}{6}\sigma_3^{2}\tau^{3} \\
\tfrac{1}{2}\sigma_2^{2}\tau^{2} + \tfrac{1}{8}\sigma_3^{2}\tau^{4}
& \sigma_2^{2}\tau + \tfrac{1}{3}\sigma_3^{2}\tau^{3}
& \tfrac{1}{2}\sigma_3^{2}\tau^{2} \\
\tfrac{1}{6}\sigma_3^{2}\tau^{3}
& \tfrac{1}{2}\sigma_3^{2}\tau^{2}
& \sigma_3^{2}\tau
\end{pmatrix}.
```

The `t_k` dependence visible in the three-state Allan variance
therefore lives in the joint `X₂, X₃` propagation, not in the
innovation covariance itself
[Zucca & Tavella 2005](@cite zucca-2005-clock-model-allan). The
two-state restriction (`σ₃ = 0`) collapses to the standard Breakiron
form

```math
Q(\Delta t) \;=\;
\begin{pmatrix}
s_\eta^{2}\,\Delta t + \tfrac{1}{3}s_\nu^{2}\,(\Delta t)^{3} & \tfrac{1}{2}s_\nu^{2}\,(\Delta t)^{2} \\
\tfrac{1}{2}s_\nu^{2}\,(\Delta t)^{2} & s_\nu^{2}\,\Delta t
\end{pmatrix},
```

with random-walk-FM density `s_η²` and random-run-FM density `s_ν²`
[Breakiron 2001](@cite breakiron-2001-kalman-timescales).

Tryon and Jones use the small-`δ` diagonal approximation
`M(t) = δ(t) Q` with diagonal entries
`(σ_ε², σ_η², σ_α²)` — the off-diagonal cross terms from the full
integration are dropped, and the two are not equivalent at finite `δ`
[Tryon & Jones 1983](@cite tryon-1983-cesium-parameter-estimation).
Breakiron calibrates the spectral densities `s_ε², s_η², s_ν²` by
least-squares fitting the Hadamard variance, which is insensitive to
deterministic drift
[Breakiron 2001](@cite breakiron-2001-kalman-timescales). The
practical recipe is unchanged: identify the dominant noise from the
ADEV slope, read off `σ_i` at the dominant `τ`, then assemble `Q`
[Zucca & Tavella 2005](@cite zucca-2005-clock-model-allan).

When `Φ`, `Q`, and `R` are block-diagonal in a multi-clock ensemble,
`P` is also block-diagonal, so the Kalman recursion factors into
per-clock 2×2 inversions and cost is linear in clock count
[Breakiron 2001](@cite breakiron-2001-kalman-timescales). When `Q` is
unknown a priori it can be calibrated from observed Allan- or
Hadamard-deviation slopes, or estimated online via the Autocovariance
Least-Squares (ALS) framework — see
[Generalized ALS noise tuning](kalman.md#generalized-als-noise-tuning)
on the Kalman page
[Åkesson et al. 2008](@cite akesson-2008-generalized-als),
[Liu et al. 2024](@cite liu-2024-adaptive-kf-rubidium).

In SigmaTau, `Q` is built by the [`process_noise`](@ref) hook on
each `AbstractClockModel`.

## Frequency jump detection

Frequency-jump detection scans a clock's fractional-frequency
residuals — after outlier and deterministic-drift removal — for step
changes in the local mean, complementing the dynamic Allan deviation
as a non-stationarity diagnostic
[Riley 2008](@cite riley-2008-frequency-jump-detection). The Stable32
toolbox documents three time-domain methods: block-average (BLKAVG),
sequential-average (SEQAVG, an adaptation of Rodionov's STARS), and
cumulative-sum (CUSUM)
[Riley 2008](@cite riley-2008-frequency-jump-detection).

The CUSUM running sum of mean-removed frequency residuals is

```math
S_i \;=\; S_{i-1} + (y_i - \bar{y}),
```

with a slope change of `S_i` marking a jump
[Riley 2008](@cite riley-2008-frequency-jump-detection). The
estimated jump magnitude from a CUSUM extremum `M` at point `P` over
`N` total points is

```math
\Delta y_{\text{jump}} \;=\; \frac{M}{P-1} + \frac{M}{N-P}.
```

BLKAVG declares a jump when the absolute difference of two
non-overlapping window means exceeds either an absolute
fractional-frequency limit or a sigma-factor times `σ_y` at an
averaging factor matching the window length; default Stable32
parameters are window length `max(N_pts/10, 5)`, zero offset, and
threshold `3 σ_y` at the corresponding averaging factor
[Riley 2008](@cite riley-2008-frequency-jump-detection). SEQAVG
reports a jump at the start of its averaging window and is therefore
biased in location; the bias is reduced by combining forward and
reversed-record SEQAVG estimates as `J = (F + (N − R))/2`
[Riley 2008](@cite riley-2008-frequency-jump-detection).

Significance is assessed against an absolute fractional-frequency
limit or a sigma-multiple of `σ_y(τ)` at the detection-window length,
in preference to a Student's-t test which is judged too sensitive for
clock noise and produces excessive false alarms on white-FM data
[Riley 2008](@cite riley-2008-frequency-jump-detection). AR(1)
prewhitening using the lag-1 autocorrelation `ρ₁` distinguishes
genuine jumps from apparent jumps caused by lurches in divergent
(flicker, random-walk) noise
[Riley 2008](@cite riley-2008-frequency-jump-detection),
[Riley 2004](@cite riley-2004-lag1-acf). The Allan deviation of a
clock record containing a jump is not strongly affected at short `τ`
but flattens and turns up at longer `τ`; that upturn is itself a clue
[Riley 2008](@cite riley-2008-frequency-jump-detection). The
confidence of a CUSUM jump can be estimated by Monte-Carlo
permutation, comparing the observed CUSUM range to a null distribution
built from random reorderings of the data
[Riley 2008](@cite riley-2008-frequency-jump-detection).

## Clock error jumps

Clock-error jumps are anomalous deterministic-time changes in the
phase, frequency, or frequency-drift state of an atomic clock that
lie outside the stationary stochastic-clock model and have been
observed in GNSS space clocks with potential safety-of-life
consequences
[Zucca & Tavella 2015](@cite zucca-2015-clock-error-jumps). The
Zucca–Tavella jump model extends the canonical three-state SDE by
adding instantaneous Heaviside-step terms `a_i dH(t − θ_i)` to each
state equation:

```math
\begin{aligned}
dX_1 &= (X_2 + \mu_1)\,dt + \sigma_1\,dW_1 + a_1\,dH(t - \theta_1), \\
dX_2 &= (X_3 + \mu_2)\,dt + \sigma_2\,dW_2 + a_2\,dH(t - \theta_2), \\
dX_3 &= \mu_3\,dt + \sigma_3\,dW_3 + a_3\,dH(t - \theta_3).
\end{aligned}
```

Three anomaly families are addressed: deterministic-time instantaneous
jumps in phase, frequency, or drift; equal-and-opposite frequency
excursions over a finite interval; and step changes in the noise
variance during a finite interval
[Zucca & Tavella 2015](@cite zucca-2015-clock-error-jumps).

A phase jump appears in the discrete iterative form as a Kronecker
delta only in its own state component; the covariance matrix `Q` is
unchanged because the jumps are deterministic
[Zucca & Tavella 2015](@cite zucca-2015-clock-error-jumps). A pair of
equal-and-opposite frequency jumps at `θ₀` and `θ₁` produces a
linear-in-`t` phase ramp during `[θ₀, θ₁]` and an accumulated phase
offset `a · H(t − θ₁)` afterward
[Zucca & Tavella 2015](@cite zucca-2015-clock-error-jumps). A
variance-increase anomaly is modelled by swapping the innovation
covariance `Q → Q′` during the affected interval while leaving the
mean trajectory unchanged
[Zucca & Tavella 2015](@cite zucca-2015-clock-error-jumps). Cholesky
factorisation `Q = A Aᵀ` gives an explicit lower-triangular `A` so
that `J_k = A Z` with `Z ∼ N(0, I)` — exact innovation generation in
three dimensions for jump-augmented simulation
[Zucca & Tavella 2015](@cite zucca-2015-clock-error-jumps).

After a frequency jump at `θ`, the time-deviation prediction error
grows linearly in `(t − θ)`; the worst case is a jump at `θ = 0`. For
a Galileo RAFS with `σ₁ = 5 × 10⁻¹²` and a 6000 s re-synchronisation
interval, the no-anomaly time-deviation 95% confidence interval is
`±1.96 σ₁ √t ≈ ±0.8 ns`; a `10⁻¹²` frequency jump at `θ = 100 s`
drives the mean to about 5.9 ns, far exceeding the noise budget
[Zucca & Tavella 2015](@cite zucca-2015-clock-error-jumps).
