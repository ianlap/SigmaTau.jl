# SigmaTau.jl — Roadmap

Working list of outstanding engineering work, sorted by priority. Items move
from this file to `CHANGELOG.md` as soon as they land — every shipped change
should remove the matching entry here and add one under `## [Unreleased]` in
the changelog in the same commit.

> **Audit date**: 2026-05-07 (after legacy-parity + EDF-fallback batch).
> Last verified end-to-end: `132/132` Stability + `15/15` Ensemble tests
> passing locally; `using SigmaTau` precompiles in ~6 s.

## 🔴 Critical

_None._ The repository builds, all subpackages test green, and the legacy
numerical reference is locked in.

---

## 🟡 High (correctness / completeness)

- [ ] **MHTOTDEV bias / EDF Monte Carlo per detrend recipe.** Synthesize
  known-noise via `_gen_powerlaw_phase` for each α; compute MHTOT and
  MHDEV; the ratio yields the bias factor `B(α)`. Re-fit `_coeff_mhtot`
  empirically per detrend recipe (`:greenhall`, `:linear`). Track
  per-recipe — EDF is recipe-specific. Spec:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-07-detrend-kwarg-design.md`
  → "Out-of-scope / future work".
- [ ] **TOTDEV `:howe` allantools cross-val tightening.** Once
  `track-b1-allantools` merges to main, update
  `lib/SigmaTauStability/test/allantools_cross_validation.jl` so the
  `"Total"` branch uses `_totdev_core(...; detrend=:howe)` at
  `rtol=1e-7` (allantools' raw `totdev` already matches our `:howe`
  to ~7 sig figs on the shared fixture; no need for the `m=512` skip
  there since allantools doesn't apply Stable32's alpha-aware
  correction).
- [ ] **TOTDEV m=512 Stable32 quirk follow-up.** The Stable32
  cross-validation testset skips the m=512 row because Stable32 reports
  a value ~1.5% larger than the raw SP1065 result (allantools agrees
  with our `:howe`). Stable32 identifies that row as FLFM (alpha=-1)
  and appears to apply an alpha-aware correction. Either confirm via
  `stable32docs/` how Stable32 derives the reported sigma at FLFM-tagged
  rows and apply the matching correction in the test, or document the
  divergence as an irreducible Stable32-vs-SP1065 policy gap.

---

## 🟡 Medium (new estimators / models)

- [ ] **`RelativisticClock`** — empty struct in
  [`clocks.jl`](lib/SigmaTauEnsemble/src/models/clocks.jl). Lunar-PNT
  future work; design the relativistic correction terms and `state_transition` /
  `process_noise` overrides.
- [ ] **`UDFactorizedFilter`** — empty struct in
  [`filters.jl`](lib/SigmaTauEnsemble/src/estimators/filters.jl). U–D
  Bierman/Thornton factorisation for low-observability lunar-distance
  measurements (numerical stability when `S` is near-singular).
- [ ] **`KuramotoOscillator`** — empty struct in same file. Nearest-neighbor
  phase coupling estimator targeted at SWaP-constrained pLEO ensembles.

---

## 🟢 Low (polish)

- [ ] **More `examples/`** — currently `quickstart.jl` and
  `clock_steering.jl`. Add:
  - `FrequencyData` ↔ `PhaseData` round-trip demo
  - Multi-clock ensemble scenario (once a multi-clock model lands)
- [ ] **Compat bounds** in subpackage `Project.toml`s — currently only
  `Distributions = "0.25.125"` is pinned in `SigmaTauStability`. Add upper
  bounds for `StaticArrays`, `Reexport`, `RecipesBase` to support
  General-registry registration cleanly.
- [ ] **`@reexport` of `tdev`, `FrequencyData`** — verified working but
  not separately smoke-tested at the umbrella level. Add a short
  `examples/`-driven smoke test or a top-level `using SigmaTau` test.

---

## 🟢 Housekeeping

- [ ] **Agent-context briefs** (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`) are gitignored
  while in active use. When the package matures and conventions stabilise,
  decide whether to delete them or to land a sanitised version (without the
  authorship rules) under `docs/contributing/`.

---

## Docs follow-ups (post-v1)

- Fill tutorial narrative — start with `01_phase_data.md` and
  `02_compute_adev.md`.
- Tighten `warnonly = []` in `docs/make.jl` once all public API has
  docstrings.
- Add `tutorials/06_masterclock.md` once C6 lands from the parallel
  implementation track.
- Add `tutorials/07_ensemble.md` once D1 lands.
- Add `validation/allantools.md` once B1 lands; extend
  `validation/methodology.md` with the three-way comparison once B2
  lands.
- Refine `docs/src/refs.bib` with DOIs and page numbers from the PDFs
  in `legdocs/papers/`.
- Convert remaining kernel docstrings (hdev, mhdev, totdev, etc.) to
  use `$(SIGNATURES)` + `jldoctest` blocks following the adev/mdev
  pattern.

## ✅ Recently completed

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the full list. Headlines from this
session:

- Documenter.jl docs subproject (`docs/`) — skeleton v1 with theory /
  tutorials / reference / validation page tree, DocStringExtensions,
  DocumenterCitations, `jldoctest` on `adev`/`mdev`, GitHub Pages CI,
  MathJax3.
- PID steering controller (`PIDController`, `step!`, `steer_to_correction`)
  ported into `SigmaTauEnsemble`; `predict!` gained an optional `steering`
  kwarg that adds a correction vector to the propagated state. Verified
  end-to-end on a drifting-clock fixture (`examples/clock_steering.jl`,
  ~600× phase-residual reduction).
- Power-law phase-noise synthesizer (`_gen_powerlaw_phase`, AbstractFFTs-based);
  MTOTDEV multi-noise validation extended from 3 to all 5 SP1065 noise types
  (WPM, FLPM, WHFM, FLFM, RWFM); ADEV/MDEV/HDEV/MHDEV kernel-parity
  cross-checked across the same alpha range
- Stable32 cross-validation (85 row checks against the
  `reference/validation/stable32gen.DAT` fixture; tight rtol on
  ADEV/MDEV/HDEV/MHDEV/TDEV, documented looser rtol on TOTDEV/HTOTDEV/MTOTDEV
  due to bias-correction policy and boundary-reflection differences with
  Stable32)
- Strict legacy-kernel parity (52 assertions, rtol=1e-12)
- TOTDEV/HTOTDEV α=2,1 EDF fallback
- MTOTDEV multi-noise validation (WPM/WHFM/RWFM)
- `tdev` API wrapper, `FrequencyData` dispatches, `StabilityResult.edf`
- `RecipesBase` package extension (replaces the `PlotRecipes.jl` stub)
- `NEFF_RELIABLE` 50 → 30 + boundary test
- GitHub Actions CI matrix
- README, CHANGELOG, project_overview, this TODO
