# # Tracking a single clock with the Kalman filter
#
# `StandardKalmanFilter` propagates a clock-state estimate through
# [`predict!`](@ref) (apply Φ, accumulate Q) and [`update!`](@ref)
# (fold in a phase measurement). Together they solve the
# minimum-variance state-tracking problem for the linear-Gaussian
# polynomial clock model.
#
# This tutorial:
#
# 1. Picks a [`ThreeStateClock`](@ref) with realistic noise levels.
# 2. Synthesises a ground-truth `[phase, frequency, drift]` trajectory
#    by sampling the model's process noise covariance directly.
# 3. Adds white phase-modulation measurement noise on top of the true
#    phase to build a noisy phase tape.
# 4. Streams those measurements through `predict!` / `update!`.
# 5. Plots the filter's phase estimate against the ground truth, and
#    the residual `phase_true − phase_est` to show convergence.
#
# This is open-loop — no controller. The closed-loop steering version
# is [Closed-loop steering with critical-damping PID gains](04_kalman_pid_steering.md).

#
# Strong WFM + RWFM contributions, no IRWFM (so Q is a 3×3 matrix
# with `q3=0` — the drift state is a pure integrator with no
# stochastic input). Tuned so the random-walk-frequency excursion
# accumulates a visible drift over the simulation horizon.

# Sample the multivariate process noise via a Cholesky factor at each
