# # Closed-loop steering with critical-damping PID gains
#
# `predict!(::KalmanFilter, …; steering = …)` accepts an
# additive correction vector applied to the predicted state mean. The
# bundled [`PIDController`](@ref) computes that correction from the
# filter's current phase / frequency estimate; together they form a
# discrete-time closed-loop control system that drives a clock toward
# zero phase residual.
#
# This tutorial:
#
# 1. Picks PI gains `(g_p, g_i)` analytically for **critical damping**
#    of the dominant phase-loop dynamics.
# 2. Drives a [`ThreeStateClock`](@ref) with a constant fractional
#    frequency offset (a deterministic drift the controller has to
#    null).
# 3. Runs a paired simulation — *open-loop* (no steering) versus
#    *closed-loop* (PID steering) — on the same noise realisation.
# 4. Plots phase, frequency estimate, and the steering signal over
#    time.
#
# This is the closed-loop counterpart of
# [Tracking a single clock with the Kalman filter](03_kalman_single_clock.md).

# ## Critical-damping derivation
#
# Treat the phase loop in continuous time. The plant integrates the
# frequency state into phase, ``\dot{x}_\text{phase} = x_\text{freq}``,
# and the PI law adds ``\text{steer} = -g_p x_\text{phase} - g_i \int
# x_\text{phase}`` to the frequency channel each step. Eliminating the
# integral gives the closed-loop ODE
#
# ```math
# \ddot{x}_\text{phase} + g_p \dot{x}_\text{phase} + g_i x_\text{phase} = 0,
# ```
#
# a second-order linear system with natural frequency
# ``\omega_n = \sqrt{g_i}`` and damping ratio ``\zeta = g_p / (2 \omega_n)``.
# Critical damping (no overshoot, fastest non-oscillatory settling) is
# ``\zeta = 1``, which fixes
#
# ```math
# g_p = 2 \sqrt{g_i}.
# ```
#
# Choosing ``\omega_n = 0.2`` rad/s gives a 2 % settling time of
# ``\approx 4 / (\zeta \omega_n) = 20`` s — reasonable for a 1 s
# discretisation step.

g_d = 0.0                      # PI only — keep the analytical match
